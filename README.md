# 2400-Project-1

Project1
Deadline - September 1, 23. Upload your solution to the dropbox in iLearn.

Part1. (50%) Exercise 1.1: 11a /page 8

Part2. (50%) Implement Consecutive integer checking algorithm for computing gcd(m, n).

Part3. (30%) (BONUS) Implement Middle-school procedure for computing gcd(m, n).

	The goal of this programming assignment is to implement a function that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers, and then output the result along with the provided input values. You will be required to create a command-line program that takes two integer arguments, m and n, calculates their GCD, and displays the result in the format: gcd(m, n) = v, where m and n are the input values, and v is the calculated GCD, or "undefined" if no GCD exists.

	You have the flexibility to implement each algorithm using the programming language of your choice.

	Your project implementations must meet the following requirements:
- Compile without any warnings.
- Include proper documentation.
